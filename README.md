## **Genshin Impact PPO Reinforcement Learning Project**

### **Overview**

This project aims to train an AI agent to autonomously play 原神 (Genshin Impact), specifically focusing on defeating bosses. We employ Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm, and implement the project using PyTorch.
